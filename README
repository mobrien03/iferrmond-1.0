WHAT IS IFERRMOND (pronounced if-err-mon-d, or i-f-err-mon-d)?

iferrmond is a (Linux x86_64) process daemon intended to run under control of systemd(1), designed to monitor configured network interfaces for kernel statistics errors, or interface down.  Depending upon the contents of the systemd iferrmond unit file iferrmond.service, logging of events (Info, Alert, Error) by iferrmond will be written to either syslog, or a log file.  If no special systemd log file configuration is applied for iferrmond, by default iferrmond logging will go to syslog (typically /var/log/messages). Additionally, journalctl(1) can be used to review the latest logs produced by iferrmond.  The primary use of the logged output of iferrmond is for a 3rd party Enterprise Monitoring (Agent) to monitor the logging destination of iferrmond.  The agent, using a regex string of the pattern: '.*iferrmond.*Error:.*', upon a match, would then produce appropriate alerting and/or trouble-ticket generation as required.

The real value of running iferrmond is realized on systems with bonded networks where an interface within a bond is encountering errors, or is down -- unbeknownst to the administrators.  Many types of errors can easily degrade throughput and go unnoticed.  And of course an interface within a bond that is un-intentionally down, can be disastrous later, if the remaining active interface went down!  In these scenarios, in order to fully realize the value of running iferrmond, it is critically important that a 3rd party enterprise manager (Agent) is actively scraping the logging destination used by iferrmond, and is properly configured to alert humans of the issues recorded by iferrmond.  However, even if the system running iferrmond has only a single network interface, and/or no bonded networks, it's useful to run iferrmond if only for the ease to regularly "grep" syslog for the presence of interface errors (reported by ifermond) that could be degrading throughput without your knowledge.

At daemon startup, if a '-c configFile' option/argument is not applied, then default values will be configured. Almost all of the defaults, with the exception of what interfaces to monitor, *should* be sufficient.  At a minimum, provide a configFile that includes configuration directive: 'Interfaces'.  (See iferrmond(1) for full details of the complete set of configuration directives available.)

iferrmond is compiled and (statically) linked against (a slightly trimmed-down) libnetlink (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netlink) written by Alexey Kuznetsov, <kuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru>.  If compiled to include '#define DEBUG 1', then additional verbose debugging output will be produced. iferrmond is installed by default in /usr/local/bin, with the .conf file in /usr/local/etc.  Reference files will reside in /usr/local/share, and this manual page should reside in the /usr/local tree. The iferrmond daemon runs un-privileged, (and currently with this verion, with reserved UID:9152 and GID:9479 - see TODO below), usually assigned to the User and Group 'iferrmond:iferrmond' respectively.

Operationally, iferrmond upon startup will issue libnetlink calls to retrieve kernel interface statistics containing error counters, and store them in local memory.  At each monitoring interval (configuration directive: monInterval) iferrmond will again retrieve the current kernel interface statistics, and compare those with the earlier statistics saved in memory. If errors have been found, greater than or equal to the monitoring threshold (configuration directive: thresHold), an event is written to the logging destination. At this point, the recent statistics will replace the stored statistics in memory, in preparation for the comparison in the next monInterval.  

In this project there is available an rpm of the latest Version/Release of iferrmond, that was created (on a SLES system) using the instructions within the INSTALL file -- so it's not necessary to "pull" from this project, and build iferrmond from sources; however, you are certainly welcome to do so.   The rpm has been tested on (recent versions of) SuSE Linux, as well as Oracle Enterprise Linux.  (NOTE! NOTE! NOTE!: Be warned that if on Ubuntu, you use "alien" to convert this .rpm to .deb, then install normally using apt, there is a risk of /usr/local/etc, /usr/local/bin, and /usr/local/man or /usr/local/share/man to vanish upon "apt" removal (if these directories were empty prior to install!) -- I'm looking at this issue -- so it's ***not recommended*** to convert the .rpm to .deb using alien on Ubuntu, but instead install the components of iferrmond manually using the HowTo in the INSTALL file). 
 
TODO: 
* Change processing around daemon username and group creation from hard-code to be determined upon startup via configuration directives and/or by using defaults
* Trap signal SIGHUP, and modify iferrmond to re-read configuration file
* Assign new configuration directive to enable debugging, instead of using #define at compile time
* Look at options around dynamic linking with libnetlink
* Consider adding a command line option to run with SysV daemon initialization, and if not there, use standard systemd methods instead as default
